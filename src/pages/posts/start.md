# My First Blog Entry: How to set up a blog?

Hi there!

Nice to meet you! My name is Paul and i am a physics student from germany who is also into coding. i code a lot for university projects, not so much for private projects. Yet. As my undergrad studies end soon, i am going to dive into job search. for job search in tech, it is said to be good to have some kind of portfolio or linkedin page or whatever. i dont have that yet, and honestly, i am a bit shy of putting myself out on linkedin without any relevant industry experience. that profile would look kinda sad. however, what i really like are personal websites and blogs. i really enjoy reading blogs of fellow scientists (yeah i am not quite there, i know). i always wanted to have an own website too, but i never really thought i had anything to say or write what it would make it worth to put there. now, when i really should start putting myself out there, i think it would be cool just to have a website to show off. i think that this has way more charme than a generic linkedin profile.

so what is the deal? i never built a website. i dont have any serious knowledge about javascript. but at least i have a topic for my first blog entry: how to set up a blog in javascript (without any js knowledge).

so how to start. first, i think it is wise to choose a tech stack. of course, i could just try vanilla js with html and css. but i read a lot of good things about astro, and some fellow tech peoples blogs also use astro. so astro it is.

i also could try out react, but i am unsure whether this would add too much complexity for a static blog site. and when in doubt whether a framework would be overkill, it likely is.

so astro it is. what are the next steps? i should define some logical next steps that can be implemented fast, so that i can see results. this is good for motivation and also for progress. if i produce measurable results in short intervals, i can quickly recognize problems and fix them. so the first step would be to get a simple hello world astro page running.

Astro has an excellent beginner tutorial on its page. So i am following this along to get a feeling for the framework.
